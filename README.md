# University-Students-Complaints-Management-System
Department of Computer Science 2019-2020 Session CSC405/434 Project - GROUP 7

### Problem
Students sometimes while trying to lodge their complaints to lecturers regarding their courses, tests or exams are instructed to write letters and submit them physically.
### Solution
This project is a Web application that allows students to lodge their complaints directly to the lecturersâ€™ inbox. The application contains a dashboard for a student to lodge or delete a complaint. The application also has a dashboard for the lecturer to view all complaints each course assigned to him/her. Treated complaints are moved to a new folder/page while the untreated ones are left in the inbox. The student is also able to view the status of each complaint.
